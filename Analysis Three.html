        <div class="maya-container">
            <p>The prevailing view, held since the early part of the 20th century and supported by scholars such as Eric Thompson and Sylvanus Morley, 
                was that the Maya were subsistent to a great extent on an agrarian system based on slash-and-burn (swidden or milpa) centered principally 
                on maize, beans, and squash, with a scattered rural populace dwelling near ceremonial centers. This model purported thin spreads of the 
                population and simple agricultural techniques. Later archaeological reconnaissance, particularly in the late 1950s around Tikal, 
                disclosed densely populated suburbs and smaller nearby centers, which defied the premise that only swidden agriculture could support 
                such higher densities. This created controversy regarding the intensification of agriculture, the position of other crops such as root 
                crops and ram√≥n nuts, and the use of artificial ecological niches such as terracing and raised fields for food production throughout the 
                year.</div>
        <div class="maya-container">
            <p>Maya farming in Belize was also very responsive, familiar with the environment, and rooted in cultural tradition. Techniques varied from 
                milpa polycultures to constructed wetland canals and terraces, each adapted to particular ecological niches. Such systems maintained high 
                population densities for centuries and showed high adaptability to environmental change. But ecological pressure was indeed a fact:
                population growth and climate stress sometimes stretched these systems to their limits. The double pressure of colonial and modern land 
                policies and crew subsistence was no longer the sole game in town causing growing tension. The battle for the recognition of land rights 
                and traditional ecological management continues to be relevant to Belize today.
