            <h3>Life During the Maya Era</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="maya-container">
            <p>A Flourishing Civilization in the Rainforest- The Maya civilization flourished between 250 and 900 CE (Common Era),
            dominating much of what is now Belize, Guatemala, and southern Mexico. Known for their monumental architecture, advanced 
            writing system, and complex calendars,  the Maya also established an agricultural base that fed millions and supported city- 
            states such as Caracol, Lamanai and Nim Li Punit. (Britannica, n.d.; BelizeHub, n.d.)
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="maya-container">
            <h3>Social Structural and Daily Life</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="maya-container">
            <p>
                Maya society was hierarchical, led by the kings, and nobles who claimed divine authority. Priests tracked the heavens and organized ceremonial life. Farmers and traders formed the foundation of the society. Agriculture was not just labor it was a sacred duty, performed in harmony with the cycle of the moon, sun and stars. (Chaa Creek, n.d.)
                <ul>
                    <li>Women contributed to food production and cultural traditions. </li>
                    <li>Children learned agricultural knowledge from elders</li>
                    <li>Rituals often marked planting and harvest seasons</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="maya-container">
            <h3>Economic Life and Agricultural Innovation</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="maya-container">
            <p> Maize was the sacred crop, but the Maya also cultivated cacao, squash, beans and chili peppers. Their success was due to innovative techniques:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Terracing to prevent erosions</li>
                <li>Milpa system (slash and burn rotational farming)</li>
                <li>Wetland raised fields with canal systems for years- round moisture (Atlas Obscura, n.d.)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="maya-container">
            <h3>Pre-Colonial Era</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="maya-container">
            <p>Before the arrival of Europeans, the Maya had already developed complex agricultural systems suited to Belizeâ€™s varying landscapes. They farmed using: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Milpa farming (slash and burn, with crop rotation)</li>
                <li>Terracing on hillsides</li>
                <li>Raised fields and canals in wetland areas</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="maya-container">
            <p>These systems allow cities like Lamanai and Caracol to feed thousands while avoiding soil exhaustion and drought damage. Farming was connected to astronomy and religion by planting was often guided by sacred calendars, and rituals honored agricultural gods like Chaac and Yum Kaax (Planet Archaeology, n.d.; Atlas Obscura, n.d.)</p>
        </div>
        <div class="maya-container">
           <h3>Colonial Era: British Rule and Cash Crop Economy</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="maya-container">
            <p>In the 17th century, British colonizers focused initially on timber extraction (logwood and mahogany), but agriculture later grew in importance. The colonial period saw:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Establishment of sugarcane plantations, especially in the north</li>
                <li>Introduction of bananas, citrus, and coconuts for export</li>
                <li>Reliance on enslaved Africans and later indentured workers</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="maya-container">
            <p>By the 1800s, agriculture was central to the economy, but land ownership was concentrated among colonial elites, leading to poverty and exclusion for indigenous and Afro-Belizeans communities (Britannica, n.d.; JSTOR, n.d.)</p>
        </div>
        <div class="maya-container">
            <h3>Early 20th Century: Resistance and Agricultural Cooperatives</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="maya-container">
            <p>In the early 1900s, dissatisfaction grew among small farmers and workers:
                <ul>
                    <li>Low wages and harsh conditions</li>
                    <li>Export dependence and vulnerability to storms</li>
                    <li>Lack of land ownership</li>
                </ul>
                (Nations Encyclopedia, n.d.)
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="maya-container">
            <h3>Post-Independence Era (1981- Present) Modernization and Challenges</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="maya-container">
            <p>After gaining independence, the government began promoting agriculture as a national development tool. Key developments included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Establishment of the Ministry of Agriculture</li>
                <li>Expansion of agricultural education and extension services</li>
                <li>Initiatives for diversification beyond sugar and citrus (e.g tilapia farming, cacao export).</li>
                <li>Land reform programs to redistribute land to small farmers and encourage rural development.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="maya-container">
            <p>Despite these efforts, the sector still faces challenges such as climate change, limited market access, and youth migration away from farming.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="maya-container">
            <h3>Belizean Society and Agriculture: A changing Perspective</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="maya-container">
            <p>Throughout history, Belizean views on agriculture have shifted:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Spiritual and ecological lifeline (Maya period)</li>
                <li>Tool of oppression (colonial plantation system)</li>
                <li>A symbol of resistance and empowerment (early 20th century movements)</li>
                <li>A foundation for national identity and economic resilience (post-independence)</li>
            </ul>
