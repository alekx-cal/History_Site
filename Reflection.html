            Agricultural activities of the ancient Maya show that they respected and appreciated nature tremendously by observing the cycles in nature and 
            the skies as opposed to ceremonious activity. Their engineered methods were new ways of doing things like the planting of crops known as the
            three sisters approach and planting according to seasons due to trends by the moon which reflected sustainable food production which could 
            sustain large numbers of people and suitable to different ecological habitat in Belize. The modern day descendants of the Maya agriculture 
            culture (represented in the places and in the names of the ancient places such as the Caracol and Lamanai) are still having some effect over 
            the cultural aspects of the present day Belize, with the common belief of having a healthy correlation with the land, which is an aspect that
            the present day society needs to learn. By appreciating the complexity of such practices, we break stereotyping of the Maya and remind about 
            the current significance of traditional ecological knowledge in solving modern problems of environment and land rights in Belize. This sense 
            of connection with ancient knowledge makes us value the concept of sustainable life more deeply and find the motivation to make steps to 
            preserve the natural environment nowadays.
