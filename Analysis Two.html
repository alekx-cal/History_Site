            <p>While exploring the agricultural practices of the ancient Maya, it is also important to recognize the ames of the sites where these took 
                place, names that carry cultural meaning, yet are often mispronounced today. In Belize, Maya archaeological sites such as Caracol, 
                Xunantunich, Altun Ha, Lamanai and Lubaantun were once the centers of knowledge, trade and farming. These names are often mispronounced 
                in English by modern speakers, but each has a Maya origin or connection and deserves to be spoken with care and respect (Hamanasi, n.d.)
                For example, Caracol, one of the largest Maya cities in Belize, was a powerful agricultural hub located deep within the Chiquibul forest.
                Its name means “snail” in Spanish, possibly symbolizing the spiral layout of the city or the importance of natural cycle. Caracol’s 
                people practiced terraced farming,built complex irrigation systems, and understood how to manage water (Travel Belize, n.d.)

            <p>Another example is Lamanai, meaning “Submerged Crocodile,” located near a fertile lagoon in Orange Walk. It was continuously occupied for
                over 3,000 years, largely because of its sustainable access to water and productive farmland (Chaa Creek, 2009). Maya farmers have 
                cultivated maize, cacao and other crops using techniques adapted to the riverbank and swampy areas. Sites like Altun Ha and Xunantunich
                were also part of an interconnected network of agricultural communities. These cities supported surrounding farming villages, where 
                people used tools made from stone, practiced crop rotation and planting with celestial events such as phases of the moon. 
                (Belize R Us, n.d.). The name Xunantunich, for instance, means “Stone Woman” and is often mispronounced as “Shoo-nan-too-nitch” instead 
                of the more accurate “Shoo-nahn-too-neech.”
