                <p>In many ways, we have witnessed the wonders of nature but have we truly contributed to protecting or sustaining it? In Belizean culture,
                    particularly in agriculture, we can see a deep connection to nature that dates back to the ancient Maya. One of their main crops was corn 
                    (maize), which they often grew alongside beans and squash, a planting method known as the “three Sisters” (Editorial Team, 2024). 
                    These crops were not only highly productive but were able to stay and be saved for long periods of time and they did not spoil.
                    Many people of our generation believe that all Mayan practices based on  civilization were rituals and sacrifices.However, the 
                    Maya did not do this as a first option. Instead Maya civilization believed in their astronomy and environmental observation 
                    (Moon phases) to guide their farming. For instance, they would follow the moon for their planting and this would differ the crops 
                    they would harvest. Based on what they saw on the moon the Mayan would perform specific ways for their cropping, one traditional 
                    example of this belief is planting of fence posts during new moon.According to Maya custom, if trees were cut during this lunar phase, 
                    the posts would sprout and grow back, eventually forming a living fence (Ambergris Caye, 2011).

                <p>Contrary to some misconceptions, the maya were not practicing  satanic rituals or diabolic rituals. Their ceremonies such as offering 
                     incense and food were acts of gratitude, typically performed after harvest, or in response to crop failure, not a form of worship 
                     to evil spirits. For example crops that  grow above the soil were planted during  New Moon; based on the time they planted the crops 
                     it was a must that at quarter moon the harvesting and pruning would occur (Ambergris Caye, 2011). So why did the Maya have this belief
                      in the Moon Lore? Most plants, for example the ones that grow on top of the soil, need healthy soil, adequate sunlight, enough water, 
                      appropriate temperatures, and essential nutrients(Your Ultimate Guide to Healthy Garden Soil, n.d.). Based on some of the gathering the
                     new moon provides proper germination and increase of moisture because of the gravitational pull which was helpful for seeds to grow faster 
                     and healthier(Arenz, 2024).
